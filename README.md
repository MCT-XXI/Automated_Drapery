# Automated_Drapery

### Application used:
Proteus 8 Professional, mikroC pro for AVR

### Concept of functioning : 
The project contains a ATMEGA32 microcontroller that activates a H-bridge in order to control a DC motor. The hour and the rotation moment when the motor has to rotat can be changed by using the two buttons (SET_Wtimer and SET_HaM, picture ATMEGA32_main). In order to know what to modify, the three Diods are there for displaying: if the clock can be changed (Ceas), if the hour when to lower the drapery can be changed (HM_Down), and if the hour when to raise the drapery can be changed  (HM_Up).
